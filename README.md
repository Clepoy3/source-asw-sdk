# source-asw-sdk
This is pretty much something like source 2013 sdk but on asw w/ some changes and will have all games from source 2007 added to it

You need to import the game content into the mod folder due to no vpk2 support (thanks Valve)
I will eventually put a download link here for tf2's content back from 2008
